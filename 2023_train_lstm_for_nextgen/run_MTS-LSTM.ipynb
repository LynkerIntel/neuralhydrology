    "# Introduction to NeuralHydrology\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before we start**\n",
    "\n",
    "- This tutorial is rendered from a Jupyter notebook that is hosted on GitHub. If you want to run the code yourself, you can find the notebook and configuration files [here](https://github.com/neuralhydrology/neuralhydrology/tree/master/examples/01-Introduction).\n",
    "- To be able to run this notebook locally, you need to download the publicly available CAMELS US rainfall-runoff dataset. See the [Data Prerequisites Tutorial](data-prerequisites.nblink) for a detailed description on where to download the data and how to structure your local dataset folder. You will also need to follow the [installation instructions](https://neuralhydrology.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/quickstart.html#installation) (the easiest option if you don't plan to implement your own models/datasets is `pip install neuralhydrology`; for other options refer to the installation instructions).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python package NeuralHydrology was was developed with a strong focus on research. The main application area is hydrology, however, in principle the code can be used with any data. To allow fast iteration of research ideas, we tried to develop the package as modular as possible so that new models, new data sets, new loss functions, new regularizations, new metrics etc. can be integrated with minor effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two different ways to use this package:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. From the terminal, making use of some high-level entry points (such as `nh-run` and `nh-run-scheduler`)\n",
    "2. From any other Python file or Jupyter Notebook, using NeuralHydrology's API\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will give a very short overview of the two different modes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both approaches require a **configuration file**. These are `.yml` files which define the entire run configuration (such as data set, basins, data periods, model specifications, etc.). A full list of config arguments is listed in the [documentation](https://neuralhydrology.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/config.html) and we highly recommend to check this page and read the documentation carefully. There is a lot that you can do with this Python package and we can't cover everything in tutorials.\n",
    "\n",
    "For every run that you start, a new folder will be created. This folder is used to store the model and optimizer checkpoints, train data means/stds (needed for scaling during inference), tensorboard log file (can be used to monitor and compare training runs visually), validation results (optionally) and training progress figures (optionally, e.g., model predictions and observations for _n_ random basins). During inference, the evaluation results will also be stored in this directory (e.g., test period results).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### TensorBoard logging\n",
    "By default, the training progress is logged in TensorBoard files (add `log_tensorboard: False` to the config to disable TensorBoard logging). If you installed a Python environment from one of our environment files, you have TensorBoard already installed. If not, you can install TensorBoard with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install tensorboard\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "To start the TensorBoard dashboard, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "tensorboard --logdir /path/to/run-dir\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also visualize multiple runs at once if you point the `--logdir` to the parent directory (useful for model intercomparison)\n",
    "\n",
    "### File logging\n",
    "In addition to TensorBoard, you will always find a file called `output.log` in the run directory. This file is a dump of the console output you see during training and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using NeuralHydrology from the Terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "### nh-run\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a run configuration file, you can use the bash command `nh-run` to train/evaluate a model. To train a model, use\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "nh-run train --config-file path/to/config.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "to evaluate the model after training, use\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "nh-run evaluate --run-dir path/to/run-directory\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### nh-run-scheduler\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to train/evaluate multiple models on different GPUs, you can use the `nh-run-scheduler`. This tool automatically distributes runs across GPUs and starts a new one, whenever one run finishes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calling `nh-run-scheduler` in `train` mode will train one model for each `.yml` file in a directory (or its sub-directories).\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "nh-run-scheduler train --directory /path/to/config-dir --runs-per-gpu 2 --gpu_ids 0 1 2 3 \n",
    "```\n",
    "Use `-runs-per-gpu` to define the number of models that are simultaneously trained on a _single_ GPU (2 in this case) and `--gpu-ids` to define which GPUs will be used (numbers are ids according to nvidia-smi). In this example, 8 models will train simultaneously on 4 different GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calling `nh-run-scheduler` in `evaluate` mode will evaluate all models in all run directories in a given root directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "nh-run-scheduler evaluate --directory /path/to/parent-run-dir/ --runs-per-gpu 2 --gpu_ids 0 1 2 3 \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## API usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides the command line tools, you can also use the NeuralHydrology package just like any other Python package by importing its modules, classes, or functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be helpful for exploratory studies with trained models, but also if you want to use some of the functions or classes within a different codebase. \n",
    "\n",
    "Look at the [API Documentation](https://neuralhydrology.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/neuralhydrology.html) for a full list of functions/classes you could use.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example shows how to train and evaluate a model via the API."

    "- By default, the config (`1_basin.yml`) assumes that you have a CUDA-capable NVIDIA GPU (see config argument `device`). In case you don't have any or you have one but want to train on the CPU, you can either change the config argument to `device: cpu` or pass `gpu=-1` to the `start_run()` function."
